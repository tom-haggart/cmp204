        <p>From a Local LAN to a Global Stage Save Point Summit was founded in 2018 by a
            small group of game development students and retro-enthusiasts. What began as a humble "Save Point" —
            a safe space for developers to showcase their prototypes and for players to enjoy vintage consoles —
            has evolved into the region's premier gaming culture convention.</p>

        <p>Our mission has always been to bridge the gap between those who play games and those who make them. Over the last five years,
            we have grown from a single-room LAN party into a massive three-day celebration of the industry, hosting industry legends,
            hosting major esports tournaments, and celebrating the art of cosplay.</p>
